# Why you should copy other people
 
Copying other people’s content is bad right? I would argue that it depends on how you do it.
 
Remember back in school, when there was a “surprise” test and you hadn’t studied for it? I can’t see why, but it did happen to me on a regular basis. I usually sat there, thinking about what little I could remember from last week’s lesson and when the teacher came around to hand out the exams it happened. My hands where shaking, my heart was racing, I was sweating. I couldn’t go home with an F. My mom would lecture me, talk about how it’s always the same, when will I ever start learning…
I had three options:
_ accept defeat and go home with an F
_ pray for my memory to be good enough to pass
_ copy
 
Every single time, I didn’t have the nerve to copy for fear of being caught. Don’t get me wrong here, copying is bad and shouldn’t be an option. You should learn your lessons on a regular basis to be prepared for any exam teachers might through at you. But, a part of me begs to ask, would it be so bad if had cheated and copied? The down sides were rather obvious, but what are the upsides of copying? Besides getting a good grade if I didn’t get caught of course.
At least I would have learned what I missed during class. I would have read the answers and written them down. Which, if you know anything about how the human brain learns, can’t be a bad thing right?
 
## Learn as you copy
 
This analogy is pretty basic and the benefits of copying aren’t high enough for anyone to rationally consider cheating. However, outside of schools, copying is a very common phenomenon! In music we have covers for example. What? Isn’t that copying? When an artist covers a song, they literally play the same notes and sing the same song. So, what’s different from copying?
 
They make their own version of the song. Sure, but what do you need in order to do that? You need to know the original song. You need to know it so well, you can make it your own. That’s the secret.
 
Copying is a step in a learning process.
The first step is watching, the second step is copying, the third step is producing your content.
 
## What about content creation?
 
Use the three steps mentioned above to learn from others. Or to elaborate more, here are basically 3 steps above in 7 steps for content creators:
1. Watch/read/listen to their content (consuming)
2. study what technics they use
3. how can you implement these technics?
4. try them out
5. analyze the benefits they bring you
6. Make them better (producing)
7. Profit 😉

This is how you will grow as a content creator. It’s not about copy and paste, it’s about learning to use what you copied. It’s the journey from a consumer to a producer.
