# How to communicate about your passion?

## Your passion is precious to you

Communicating about your passion is delicate. I’m sure you can talk about your passion all day long, but how do you make sure people listen to you?
Your passion is precious to you but it's not for everyone.
Do you give as much details as you can so that just a few will follow your train of thought? Or keep it as broad as possible to get the majority to listen? 

The answer isn’t one or the other. 

Think about the last time you talked for more than ten minutes about your hobby with someone (and it went well). Visualize it, you are in front of that person. How did you approach the topic? Did you catch their attention? Changes are you didn’t think much, you just shared your joy and feelings without much filter. Right? Capture that, get that into an elaborate text/video/podcast : BOOM! This is what people want to read/watch/hear, because that is gold to the ones that know how to appreciate it like you do.

## How to make sure it gets to the right people?

Less is more. If you reach one person who is interested in your content and consume it regularly it is a lot more valuable then reaching a thousand who just pretend. It’s like having a thousand facebook friends who only remembers you once a year because facebook tells them it’s your birthday. You know, the ‘friends’ you consider unfriending every now and then but never do. 
Reaching one fan will lead to more. One fan can share your content to two of their friends, who share it to two others friends, who share it to two other friends and before you know it you have a little crowd of interested fans!
