# The benefits of being unknown

One of the most frustrating things as a content creator is having 0 followers.

Motivation starts to drop. You publish less and less content and the quality of your content goes down.

## Being invisible is a super power

However, there are benefits to being unknown. Starting out as a content creator. Your content is just a particle in the ocean.

People won't notice you. And that's a good thing. The good thing is, nobody will see your first mistakes. Nobody will read your poorly written blog, horrible video or bad podcast. At least, they won't at first.

Your first mistakes can be the biggest ones and no one will care because nobody watches. You have no responsibilities whatsoever towards your audience, because you have no audience.

It's like being a teen and your parents just went on a weekend trip: it's time to have some fun! You can't disappoint anyone!

You are invisible. Use that as your super power. Don't mark it down as a drawback.

## You have no accountability

The counterpart is, you have no accountability, which means you can do whatever you want, but having that freedom bears a price. Will you be brave enough to follow through, take action and be consistent if you have no one to account to?

Having that freedom opens the doors to procrastination. That's the biggest test. It tests your motivation.

How bad do you want content to be out there? Do you really want to be a content creator? Are you willing to invest so much time and effort without getting anything in return for months?

That's the real test. That's where many content creators fail.

That's why you should focus on your mindset. You don't care how many people are watching. You don't care what they say about you. You'll publish your content, anyways. **No matter how long it will take, no matter how much you have to give.**

*Without expecting anything in return. I'm willing to do it anyway.*

## Establish yourself

Have you ever seen a house during its construction? Could you sleep in a house without a roof and without doors for one night? That doesn't sound safe, right? You would be far better off sleeping in a nice little house, in a cozy bedroom with a fluffy carpet and a generous bed. **Your content is like a house.** At first your content is rough, unfinished and isn't worthy, staying in for long. It's easy to give up and leave your house unfinished. But then, it would just be another unfinished house.

How will you feel about that unfinished house in 3 years? Will you go back to the weathered construction site and feel proud? Will you have a smile on your face while you imagine how much you believed in building this house, but it led to nothing? I don't think so. **Regret is all you'll be left with.**

Get your life together and continue building your dream house brick by brick. There will be a time when you'll be proud of yourself.
