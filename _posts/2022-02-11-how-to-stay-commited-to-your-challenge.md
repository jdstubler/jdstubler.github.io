# How to stay committed to your 90-day plan

In the last post we talked about the 90-day plan and what made it so powerful. You may have already heard of the phrase **with great power comes great responsibility.**  

## The grind

It is very powerful because it's very hard to achieve. Unlike finishing a 30-day plan, 90 days is a long time! (duh...) Waking up each morning, feeling insecure and stressed about your next video/podcast/blog post, you long for the time you just had to go to do your daily job. In fact, your daily job doesn't feel that bad anymore,  right?

## Don't stop now!

Pushing yourself every day is hard. If it wasn't, everybody would do it! It's hard because you are getting away from your comfort zone and your instinct doesn't like that. Your instinct is telling you to stop and be content with what you already have. It could be worse after all!

That's where your mind has to be strong. Yes, it could be worse, but your life could be a lot better! If you push forward, you deserve to better. If you don't, you will never leave your current position.

When covid hit, I took a job as a cleaner. I didn't want that job, but I have a family to care for, which leaves me no other choice. Or so I thought. Back then, I had the same internet access I have today, a working smartphone and even a laptop. Deep down I know I always had a choice. But what did I do? Nothing. For one whole year, I kept hoping for change to come to me. I told myself I was trying the best I could, but it never worked out. If you feel the same now or know you will eventually fall in that sooner or later, do this.

## The contract

If you are a serial procrastinator like me, you will fail your 90-day challenge. IF you keep to yourself. You need someone to hold you accountable. But how do you make sure they will push you no matter what?

The answer is you don't. You will push yourself. It seems illogical but the solution is easy.

Make a contract with your best friend: *You will publish one full piece of content 6 times a week. If you don't manage for whatever reason to meet your commitment, you'll have to pay your friend.*

The sum can be anything but ideally it should be high enough to push you to get to work no matter what, but not too high to be a sum you could realistically not even make the payment.

Alright, enough for today, get to work or someone will cash out while you're procrastinating ;)
