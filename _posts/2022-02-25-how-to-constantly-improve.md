# How to constantly improve

Your dream is to become a content creator, but you stay on your phone all day? Your dream is to become a content creator, but you're in front of the TV every night. Your dream is to become a content creator, but every afternoon you play video games.

How do you want to progress if you don't put in the work to get better?

## I'm learning

Are you? Just because you watch tutorials and motivational videos doesn't make you a better content creator. Don't tell me you are on your phone all day because you're learning skills. Yes, learning is important, but it doesn't count as working. How much time do you invest in achieving your dream every day? Are you actively working and getting out of your comfort zone? If not, you're just fooling yourself. There's no way you'll get closer to your goal by passively learning and waiting.

## Producing

You have to choose to get better at producing. If you consume, you are just better at consuming. And a content  creator does consume content, but they produce more than they consume.

So what holds you back? What holds you back is you don't see any progress, but why don't you see any progress?

Because your views don't change?
Because you'll listener count isn't going up? Because, your website, your blog, hasn't been clicked on?

You know what? That's normal.

Everyone has that. Think about the biggest names you are currently following. They did go through what you go through now.

**The only difference between you and them, is they persevered long enough and improved long enough to see results.**

## But how do you persevere?

**You stop obsessing about numbers.**

Because numbers won't go up just because you think you deserve it. Focus on:

**What will bring viewers to your video?**

**What would bring listeners to your podcast?**

**What will bring readers to your blog posts? **

What is present in others' content that isn't in yours? Why? Should you implement it into your content? How?
That's why you want to sharpen your skills.
Don't watch anything else. Focus on improving your skills.

When I started playing guitar in 2012,  I was playing alone in my bedroom for fun. I played for myself because I loved playing guitar, but it did go a lot deeper.

I didn't just love playing music. I got addicted to seeing progress. Everyday I improved a bit more. And as long as I saw my skill level getting higher, I didn't stop playing.

This is something very powerful. If you get addicted to improving, it doesn't matter how many viewers you have, how many listeners you have, how many readers you have. You won't ever stop.

**Now get started and sharpen your skills!**
