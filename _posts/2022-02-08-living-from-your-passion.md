## Sharing your content

Living from your passion implies showing it to the world. If you don't get it out there how are you supposed to make an income out of your content? 

It sounds simple but it's one of the most difficult steps! 

At the time of this writing, my son is nearly three years old. A few months ago me and my wife showed him pictures of us when we were toddlers. ‘Look who it is! It’s Dad!’ I told him. He didn’t believe me, he only knew us as adults, these toodlers on these pictures were strangers to him. Of course, now he’s grown a bit and understands that adults like his parents and grand-parents were once kids like him.

It’s the same with successful people. We often look up to them, idolising them, but they were once were you’re at now. They once shared their first video, first single, first blog post, gave their first speech, and their were scared as you are scared now. 

You will become successful if you overcome your fears and use them as lessons to become better.

Because you can't hit 10000 views if you never share it.

Your content can't and won't be perfect at first, but in order to publish your perfect 54th video or your perfect 36th blog post you have to start by one!

But of course you know this already don’t you?

## Finding the right platform

Before you’ll step up and jump into the unknown, you’ll have to pick somewhere to start.

There's many theories about what platform to use for what type of content. But do they matter?

Two years ago I wanted to share my passion for traveling. I followed a guide which advised to create an Instagram account. It was the preferred choice for travel content, and it made sense, travel pictures was listed in the top categories and had many trending hashtags... I couldn't fail right?

I wasn't using Instagram at the time which meant I had to learn everything from scratch. I learned many tricks and hacks to gain followers, tried many filters, tried partnering with Influencers. The results were depressing. After nearly a year of struggle, I barely passed the 1000 follower mark. 

Why? Because I wasn't familiar with the platform! I never saw Instagram from a user point of view, I started Instagram as a business.

It may seem strange, but if you pick a platform you're using frequently, you have a big advantage over entrepreneurs who don't. Subconsciously you know what users are searching for, what they want to watch, what they want to read. Just take a pen and paper, and reflect on what you are doing as a user.

## Still scared?

Think about it, showing your content is like public speaking. Imagine yourself talking about your passion in front of a huge crowd. Does it make nervous? It sure makes me nervous! And it's absolutely normal!

But you know what?

## You don't have to share it live

You can share your passion while being all alone and comfy, share the recording/script online and it will get to the right people. Don't worry about how, when and where for the moment. Just be yourself, share something about what you love and people will be drawn to you. 

So pick your favorite , and start publishing!
