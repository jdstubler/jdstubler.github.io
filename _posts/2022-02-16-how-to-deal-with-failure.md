#‌ How to deal with failure as a content creator 

## The beginning 

Back in 2012. I started playing guitar. 

Two years later, I got to a decent level. A skill level I was proud of. If you had told me back then, that 8 years later, I would still be roughly at the same level, I would have stopped playing.  

What happened? I moved out of my parents house and didn't play with my father on a regular basis anymore. There was nothing pushing me to learn a new music piece, nothing to push me to improve. 

If you're a lonely content creator you are experiencing the same. What happens if you don't publish your next blog post? What happens if your youtube channel fades away? Nothing. It depends on you to keep it alive long enough for the outside world to care. Once your content reaches an audience you will be held accountable in some way. Until then it depends on you alone. 

I proposed a solution about this issue <a href="https://jdstubler.com/2022/02/11/how-to-stay-commited-to-your-challenge.html">here</a>.

## Congrats 

Independent on your current struggles right now, I want to congratulate you. You got through some bad times and are still here and reading, in search of improving yourself. That means you haven’t given up. Even if you failed to upload your youtube video in time, haven’t posted a single blog in 6 months, have been publishing podcasts regularly but no one listens; you are still in the game. The idea of achieving your goal is still lingering in your mind telling you to try again. 

Congrats to you, because no matter what your parents/friends tell you, you are still trying. That makes you strong. For all the reasons there are not to pursue your dream, you have ignored them all. Now, if I tell you, you will fail again, would you continue to try? How much failure does it take for you to stop trying?

## Getting immune to failure 

During the time I was single, I was becoming used to failed dates. However, there’s one thing that struck me now that I didn’t realize back then: * I was surrounded by people who wouldn’t let me give up *.
My parents wanted grandkids so they surely weren’t going to tell me to stop trying, my friends were there for me when I felt down and it never crossed my mind to stop anyway. Same thing with improving my guitar skills, my father was holding me accountable without ever pressuring me or anything, I just wanted to make him proud. 

Why is it different being a content creator? Why are my loved ones not as supportive as they were in regards to dating? Because dating is something that has been around for thousands of years. Because my father played guitar since he was thirteen. Content creation, especially on internet is quite new. It’s considered unsafe, not suited for secure income generation. 

What does it mean for you? It means, you’ll have very few people if any, to boost yourself back up once you’ll fail. Unless you find a community that does exactly that. A community that share similar dreams and shine with positivity. A community that wants you to succeed. 

We are currently building such a community and would be honored to count you among us. I share the 5 essential steps to becoming a content creator as a welcome gift <a href="https://jd.systeme.io/5-steps-to-content-creation">here!</a>

## Quick fix 

Don’t listen to negativity when it comes to your dream. Your dream of becoming a content creator is precious. It depends on you to make it happen. Won’t you be thankful 3 years from now to have pursued your dream? 

Listen to people who are where you want to be. Only they know how to get there. Have at least three of them and follow their advice and listen to their story. There's a high chance they've been through your current struggles before. This will get you away from negativity and into positivity.
 
Good luck out there!
