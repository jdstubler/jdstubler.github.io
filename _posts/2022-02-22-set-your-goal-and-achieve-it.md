# How to set your goal and achieve it 

I've said it before on this blog, last year, I tried to start a YouTube channel. I had big plans. My goal was to publish two videos of week, in order for me to have 24 videos out in three months. 

## The problem 

This had two purposes. One was, it looks better when you have more videos on your channel. The likelyhood of a viewer hitting the subscribe button is significantly higher. 

Secondly, my content would be connected. It would give me I higher chance to hook the viewer into binging my content, once they watch one video. Thus creating long watch time and session time. 

Anyway, I started on week one. Published only one video. I felt like a failure because I failed my own goal. I was one video short right from the start. And instead of correcting myself, pushing myself I corrected my goal. I lowered my goal to publish only one video per week. 

The next week, I didn't publish anything. Guess what I did next. 

I set my goal to publish one video every other week. Which in numbers means, I went from publishing 24 videos in three months to publishing 12 videos, to publishing only six. In the same time frame. 

The huge problem is not the publishing schedule. Two videos, a month is great. However, that's a topic for another day. 

Now, the biggest problem was: I lowered my goal. 

## Why is it a big problem? 

There's three types of goals. 

**Achievable ones, challenging ones and impossible ones.** 

The problem with that is I started with a nearly impossible goal for me at the time, it took me 10 hours to make one video. I needed to free up 20 hours per week to make it happen. 

Cutting my goal in half, meant it was still a challenging goal, finding 10 hours a week to publish one video. 

Cutting it again in half took the challenge away. *Achievable goals are useless.* These aren't even meant to be goals. 
The biggest problem is how easy it is. The easier it is, the less attention you'll give it, the less important it gets. How likely is it that you will complete your goal if it isn't among your top priorities?

In contrast, if you take a challenging goal, you can't waste any time because you know it's hard. You will cut every corner, focus on what's important, focus on what will bring you closer to your goal faster. 

That's the power. That's The Power of choosing a challenging goal, or an impossible goal. 

The power in the challenging goal, lies in the way you are going to push yourself. Your brain will search for ways to become more efficient, to take less time. 

By choosing to publish two videos a week, one podcast everyday, or one blog post everyday, you have to become efficient. Or it won't be doable in the long run. 

Reducing your posting schedule gives you gives you more Liberty. Yes. You will be more creative, if you reduce your posting schedule, absolutely.Â  But there's one pattern you will notice. You will take more and more time for each post. This can make or break your project, if it isn't sustainable in the long run, it will be exhausting and you'll quit if you don't see results. You'll never hit the goals you've set yourself. 

If you train your brain into becoming more efficient in creating content, you will become acustomed to it. 

**First benefit:** It won't take your as long obviously.

**Second benefit:** Your content won't be as precious to you. You're less likely to be disappointed if you don't have great results. 

**And the last benefit is:** You will see advancement, you will see that you take less, and less time to create content. And that's an improvement. That's the opposite of what you would feel if you publish less and less. 

Your primary goal shouldn't be getting views or getting readers. Your primary goal should be to get efficient at what you're doing and gather skill. 

## Your goal 

The best goal should be between a challenging one, and an impossible one. If you take a truly impossible goal, luou won't do it. So why even bother trying? Try to find your sweet spot. The one spot that you know, you are you're going to have a hard time. 

You will have a hard time creating during first two or three weeks, but you will benefit from it in the future.
