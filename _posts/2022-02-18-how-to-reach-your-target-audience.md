# How to Reach your Target Audience?

Last year, I had a brilliant idea.

After failing to share my passion for traveling on Instagram. I turned to YouTube. As I like gaming, as well as traveling, I merged the two.

I created a gaming travel channel. Where I played, Microsoft flight simulator 2020.

That might be a good idea, but a successful YouTube channel doesn't happen on just a good idea.

## Skills

The problem was I didn't have skills. While true, that was only part of the problem.

I lacked storytelling skills, video montage skills, audience retention skills. I knew that, and I was ready to address and correct these issues. What I didn't know, was I lacked clarity about my niche.

## Who is your target audience?

Your target audience is the one that consumes your content, the one that you specifically target with your content.

Think about it. Who is your target audience? What is your ideal consumer?

You might say, "well, of course, I know him, he's me." Sure, that's a very good starting point. You are producing content for someone that is like you, perfect. No worries, there. But, you have to go deeper than that to really reach the people that you want to reach.

Who will consume your content? What do you do for whom? The answer fits in one sentence. For example : *I create tutorials on learning to bicycle for adults* or *I write about making friends as an introverted gamer*.

I do *blank* for *blank*.

And don't tell me, I do YouTube videos for people like me because it's lame, that isn't a niche. That's the same as saying I do YouTube videos for myself. Well, why do you put them on public? If you do them for yourself, you might as well buy some Google drive space and put the videos on there, right?

That's exactly what I lacked. I made videos for myself. I liked the videos I put out there, but what was the incentive for someone to watch them?

Remember, you are at the stage where nobody knows who you are, what you do? Why are you doing it? You have to tell them, you have to show them, in order for them to care about what you do.

Put yourself inside the head of your ideal consumer. They are not specifically searching for your content. There are searching for a solution to their problem. You have to show them why I, why is your content solution to their problem? Why do they have to care about your content?

Remember, they come with no context whatsoever to your content.

## Interacting with your target audience

You see, it's like having a conversation with a very good friend. You'll have all these inside jokes, that only you two know, understand and laugh to. If someone doesn't know all these inside jokes, they won't listen to you because they won't laugh or they don't understand what you are talking about. You have to create a connection first and build a relationship with your audience.

That's creating a connection. It is how do you talk to your target audience? What language do you use? Brainstorm your ideas and write them down. Take a step back and read what you've just written. Is it something would enjoy? Find interesting? Do you want more of that content?

## Learn from yourself

The best way to appeal to an audience that is similar to you, is to understand what made you read/watch/listen to someone else. How did you find their content? How did you get hooked into consuming more of their content?

If you find this out and use it in your content, nothing can stop you. It doesn't matter if it's not the same content, you can learn from anyone.

Make sure your idea isn't tossed into the bin, next to all the previous ones that could have been great!
