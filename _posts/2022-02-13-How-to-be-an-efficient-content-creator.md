# How to be efficient as a content creator.

How much time do you invest in content creation every day? Does it feel too much for the content that you create? Do you feel like you can improve that?

Well, maybe it's time to think about being more efficient.

Where can you save time? Where do you need more time?

## Planning

If you don't already, plan everything you do. Track how much time you need for every activity related to your content. Once you have enough data, you can start searching for patterns. When during the day was it easier for you to edit a video, to write on your blog or to record a podcast? At what time of the day did ideas come naturally? When was taking a break beneficial?

Do you see how important this is? Knowing this, you can plan your day to always have the right activity that falls into the best time frame.


## System building

Now that we have the planning done. One thing you should do is build a system. What do I mean by that?

I mean creating a structure that facilitates your content creation. Like a story that has a beginning, a middle and an end. You want to have each and every piece of content you publish to have that. That's why you should create a template and use it as a guide.

The easier and flawless the content creation process gets, the more content you are willing and able to make. It gives you longevity.

Another benefit shows in the long run. If your content follows a custom structure, it will be recognizable, it will make it easily digestible and unique.


## Shortcuts

There are a lot of tools out there that can help you to be more time-efficient.

Instead of typing a blog post out, use a tool to speak it out whenever you can. Use and memorize keyboard shortcuts for video editing. Use software that automatically cuts out silence if you're doing a podcast.

I hope these keys will help you put out content faster, and not be afraid of the tremendous work that awaits you.
