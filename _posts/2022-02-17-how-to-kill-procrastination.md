# How to kill procrastination?
 
There’s an exam tomorrow and I haven’t started learning. It’s only 6 PM, I have the whole evening, that’s fine. Let me just watch one episode of game of thrones.

One hour later: That’s an insane cliffhanger! Just one more episode and then I’ll start working for real.

One hour later: Alright, I’ll start working now, let me just check my phone for a sec…

That’s how I lived life since I can remember. I became an expert in last minute working. I always joked about it but it wasn’t something to be proud of. Deep down I knew this was a problem I needed to fix. Remember, I’m expert procrastinator, so I procrastinated fixing my procrastination. That’s some next level delaying.

Somehow, I needed to prevent myself from stalling every time.

## Realization

The first step in fixing my work ethic was to understand why I was procrastinating so much in the first place. Was it because I had access to too much entertainment? Sure, this seemed like a logical cause, too much distraction leads to less focus. So, I tried getting off of distractions for a while. Cutting TV to a minimum. Switching my phone to power saving mode to limit my access to only four apps. Yes, that’s it I can think clearer now!

Then, something strange happened. Something I didn’t expect at all. I started reading more. While reading is by no means bad it didn’t help my procrastination problem. I had a solution that fixed a problem I didn’t focus on solving. We’ll take a look at that problem soon, but let’s go back to my original problem. How was it possible that I was still struggling to finish any kind of project, despite having cut-off the source of the problem?

Should I burn all my books and try living without any distractions what so ever? No, my brain was subconsciously searching for any way possible to delay what I dreaded doing. What ever I did I would always find a way to avoid what I planned on doing. Maybe it’s just me, how does everyone else deal with procrastination just fine and I’m struggling to even find some way to avoid it?

## Finding the real problem

To find the solution, I need to find the problem first. What’s the problem? How on earth can I put off laundry for two weeks, but right when I had an urgent project, I took all the care in the world to do the laundry. All the while patting myself on the shoulder, after all, I was finally doing the laundry, which meant I wasn’t delaying it any further, thus I wasn’t procrastinating. This was getting worse by the day! I had to stop delaying everything and anything! Or at least focus on what was important first, like work, finishing off projects and getting paper work done.

Thinking about all this made me dizzy with how much I had to do. I started blaming myself for delaying so many things for so long, why was I doing this to myself?!

## The solution

It had to stop now. I took a piece of paper and started writing all the things I needed to do. Everything in the exact order it flowed out of my mind. Then I started highlighting what was urgent and had to be done today. Would you look at that, there were only a few things that needed my immediate attention: among them was ‘writing a blog’, the one I was avoiding all along. Was I on the verge of ending years of delaying projects? Projects I have been passionate about but never finished or barely even started?  

No, I was still torn apart: I deeply wanted to get going with creating my own blog, but was held back by how much time and effort it demanded. Therefore, I made a plan, detailing each step. If I knew how to solve one step, I would write how long it would take me; if I didn’t, I searched online for solutions and made assumptions on how long it would take me based on my research. Setting the blog up was done in about two hours. **I had delayed creating a blog for a whole month when it only took two hours to set up**.

What did I learn? Clarity is the key killing procrastination. Always elaborate a plan **on paper!**  Having a plan makes sure you will stay focused on one task at a time. Having your plan written out relieves the pressure of remembering everything. Your mind can fully concentrate on solving one thing at a time.

Procrastination comes from a lack of clarity.
