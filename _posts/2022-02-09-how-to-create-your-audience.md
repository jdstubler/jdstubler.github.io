Title: How to create your audience?

## The basics

As I mentioned in a previous post, two years ago I tried to share my passion for traveling on Instagram. It didn't go as planned. You see, my plan was to share travel pictures (you don’t say duh…), put trending hashtags on them on watch my following grow on it’s own.
Lovely isn’t it?

As you can tell, it was a lot harder than that. What was I missing? What did separate my content from the top ones? It seemed like an impossible task to achieve. That’s when self doubt and excuses came creeping in: 
** It’s too late to start on Instagram, I’m not made for this, I’m not confident enough, my hashtags aren’t good enough **

If you feel the same right now, ask yourself, do you think hashtags, tags or CEOs will make a difference? Don’t get me wrong, hashtags, tags, and CEOs are relevant, but not before you figure out the basics. It’s like having chocolate sprinkles but no cake, it’s not a real desert is it?

## Likes, comments, shares

During my journey on Instagram, I did a lot of mistakes, my biggest one though might be counterintuitive: I focused on Likes and comments. In reality, Likes and shares don’t matter. Comments alone don’t get you far.

If you’re using social media to build your business, than likes, comments, shares or even follows alone aren’t paying your bills. It helps to reach more people, but if the crowd you reach doesn’t do more than liking, commenting and sharing than having 100k followers is just the same than having 100. 

Why do I tell you this? Because when you’re starting off, you have to get away from every distraction in order to focus on what really matters. Mark Zuckerberg for example, actively rejected ideas he got from his team in the early days of facebook, which wouldn’t bring him more users. Every time team members came into his office and presented him a feature or an idea they wanted to implement, Mark asked ‘will it bring more users to facebook?’. If the answer was no then there was no point in adding it.

## What should you focus on then?

Focus on your message. 

What do you want to tell your audience? What is important to you? What value can you give your audience? 

Share your personal experience in a particular topic. Share your struggles and the solutions you found to these struggles. Your target audience is an audience that can identify themselves with you.

That’s what your target audience seeks, that’s how they will find you and more importantely that’s how they will stay.
