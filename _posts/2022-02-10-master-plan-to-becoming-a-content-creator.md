# The master plan to becoming a content creator 

Passionate, pumped up and full of ideas. You are ready to become content creator. Great, but do you have a plan? Do you have a plan that will lead you to success? If not, read on. 

## Accept messiness 

Having a plan is the difference between waiting for luck to come around and knowing you will succeed in the near future. But it doesn't mean you will know exactly what the next step is. You will fail, and the more you fail the better. Most of the successful people will tell you : they know what you shouldn't do because they've been there before and learned from these failures. 

## Why is having a plan so important? 

Planning is not only about structuring your goal into day to day task, it serves as a mind bridge. If you write down a goal and come up with an achievable plan that will get you to that goal, then it becomes suddenly doable. Something you thought was out of sight becomes tangible. 

## The 90 days plan 

So the first step is taking a piece of paper and brainstorming each and every idea that comes up in your mind. These are precious. You want to keep them at hand at any time and write down more as you go. 

You will need them. These are content ideas, even they seem weird or undoable now, in a few months you might feel otherwise. 

Maybe you've heard about a 90-day plan. Well, this is the master plan. 

Independent of which platform you choose from, you will have to publish at a fast rate. This means 5 to 6 content creations a week. 

If you can do more than seven then it's not a rich content creation. Because posting a picture, on Instagram with a few hashtags isn't rich content, it requires 5 to 10 minutes. That's not what people will get hooked on and that's not what will get you closer to your goal. A rich content creation has a structure, a beginning and an end and requires at least 1-2 hours of work. 

Don't panic, the more you do these, the faster you'll get. 

Don't panic if you don't have enough ideas for a 90 days run, you will figure that out on the way. Make a detailed plan for your first 2 weeks with the best ideas you came up with while brainstorming and start publishing right now. 

## Why 90 days? 

30 days seems more doable right? 30 days is just a month, that's okay. That's exactly why I'm telling you to go for 90 days. You don't see yourself in 90 days. You have absolutely no idea what you will have achieved 90 days from now. Why? Because you overestimate what you can do in 30 days but underestimate what you'll do in 90. Test yourself, write what you think you will achieve in 30 days and write down what you think you will achieve 90 days from now on a piece of paper. Fold it and put it away. Do not open it before your 90 days challenge is over. 

You can thank me in 90 days :)
