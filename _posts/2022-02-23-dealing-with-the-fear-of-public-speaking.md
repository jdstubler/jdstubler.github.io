# Dealing with the fear of public speaking

When I was at school, my worst nightmare was speaking in front of the class. Every time there was a presentation due for the following day, I was stressed out. I was stressed out to the point of having a sleepless night.

The next day, right before being called to present in front of the class, I would frantically read my notes. In a desperate attempt to fuel my courage, instead of my fears. Instead, it only made the situation worse. Especially if I didn't know my notes by heart.

I vividly remember when my name was called out. My heart rate would literally drop. My knees were shaking as I was standing up and walking towards the front of the class. My heart was bursting out of my chest, as I was turning to face the class. The silence became unbearable and the room. Everyone was looking at me, while I wasn't even capable of making a clear sentence in my head. Even less speaking it out loud.

These are memories I tried to forget for a long time. But they didn't fade, so I learned from them instead.

## Stress

Stress is your worst enemy in this situation, right? It makes your heart rate go up, your knees shake and your palms sweaty. The more you notice it, the worse it gets.

**It's the worst feeling ever.**

But what if you could use that stress?
What if you could harness your fear? And channel it into something great.

## You're not alone

The first step is to understand that you are not alone as an introvert. Many celebrities have the same problem if you believe it or not. **Celebrities that may look extraverted are in fact introverted (Emma Watson, Bill Gates, Meryl Streep).**

## solutions

**Make notes of what triggers this kind of stress.** Think about what could make you feel more comfortable. Do the same in situations where you are comfortable and try to spot what makes them comfortable for you.

**Practice daily by speaking in front of a mirror.** That way you'll see how others see you. Remember: **you are a hundred times stricter with yourself than others are towards you.**

**Speak to yourself**, when you're driving or alone, like you would speak in front of a crowd. Take a video of you speaking. When do you speak clearly and when do you not? How are your gestures?

**Keep these recordings and watch them again at regular intervals.** You might spot things you didn't while watching it on the day of recording.

Watching yourself will be cringe worthy at first, but you will become accustomed to it.

**Correct yourself** over time. Correct your speaking speed, the clarity of your speech, your gestures and postures.

## Conclusion

There is no secret cure to the fear of public speaking, but you can practice enough to feel more confident and thus channel your fears. I'm sure you will see huge improvements over time!

**You can do it!**
