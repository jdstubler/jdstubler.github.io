# Creating good habits 

One month ago, I started writing this blog. My goal was to write 5 blog posts a week. 

Although, it sounded really hard at first, I knew it to be possible. I knew it would take me less and less time to write an article over time.

## building a habit 

I've read multiple times that it takes about three weeks of daily action to create a good habit. Now, unfortunately, I couldn't fully complete 3 weeks because I got sick and I had to take a break for two weeks. 
That's why I doing a wrap up now. What did I learn in those three weeks? 

There are three keys to cresting a good habit. 

First, stay **consistent**. If you don't stay consistent, you won't see any progression. 

The second one is, of course **progression**. If you stay consistent, you'll see progression. If you see progression you'll stay consistent. These two pairs go hand in hand. 

The third one is creativity. 

You can stay consistent and see a progression, but if you lack creativity, you will run out of ideas and ultimately stop. 

So not only will you have to stay consistent with your content. You will have to stay consistent in the consumption of content, hat leads you to create. 

What I mean by that, is specifically consume content that you know will lead to new ideas. Not much, you don't want to create a bad habit do you? Just enough to insure you'll have a constant flow of content creation ideas to keep your output consistent.

## Bad habits 

I've never met someone who purposefully created bad habits. 

That's not something we want to do, right?
But we do that every single day. We create bad habits. And it's up to us, to work on eliminating bad habit. 

Take 30 seconds to reflect on yourself. Think what did you pick up as a detrimental habit today? Maybe there isn't any? Perfect, but chances are there's at least one thing. 

The reason I want you to focus on the new bad habits is because once they started, you get accustomed to them, and it becomes way harder to eliminate. 

So, you should focus on eliminating them right away. Then you can focus on bad habits you had for a while. I want you to grab three bad habits you currently have. 

Look at them. Feel them. This is just tip of the iceberg. Bad habits are all around you. You've picked up bad habits all your life and never focused on them. Now is the time to focus on them to see what they really do to you. 

How do they harm you? How they block your way towards Greatness? Ask yourself. Why did you pick up these bad habits? 

This will make you one step closer to giving them up.

## The hard part 

Now that you have identified your bad habits, you can focus on good habits. I want you to pick three good habits you want to incorporate in your daily life. 

Replace your three bad habits, eith three good habits. 

See how I don't even talk about really giving up bad habits, because if you replace bad habits with good habits, you won't have time to think about your bad ones. 

## How much time does it take to create a good habit? 

It takes about three weeks of hard work, three weeks of getting accustomed to a good habit, because a good habit is, most of the time, harder to pick up than a bad one. It's out of your comfort zone and that's why bad habits are so hard. They require will and hard work. 

It's a lot easier to sit on the couch in front of a TV, instead of doing work or doing something creative. 

And that's where the real work begins. It won't be a strong habit after 3 weeks, as it's not a strong habit for me to write a blog post at the moment. But it's much easier than it was in the beginning. It's something I can do each day. 

However, it's definitely not as strong of a habit as brushing my teeth, for example. If I don't brush my teeth, I'll feel uncomfortable. I'll feel like something is stuck between my teeth. I'll feel like my mouth stinks. I'll uncomfortable around others as well. *Its a short term pain, which can be dealt in 2 minutes and yields a short term gain.* That pushes me to brush my teeth. 

However, if I don't write my blog post, there is very little short term drawback. I have to rely on my mind to stay consistent even *if there's isn't any short term gains or pains involved.* 

And that's the hardest part. 

Having a strong enough will that not only creates good habits, but pushes you to keep them.
